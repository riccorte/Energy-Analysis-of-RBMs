# RBM Hyperparameters and Energy Analysis

This project focused on the study of **Restricted Boltzmann Machines (RBMs)**, with an emphasis on understanding how **hyperparameter choices** affect the **energy landscape** and hidden representations. Dimensionality reduction and clustering techniques were applied to explore the structure of the hidden space.


## Methodology
- Systematic variation of key RBM hyperparameters (number of hidden units, learning rate, etc.).  
- Analysis of the resulting **energy landscape**.  
- Application of **PCA**, **t-SNE**, and clustering to investigate the organization of hidden representations.  
- Evaluation of patterns and correlations between hyperparameters and latent space structure.  


## Results
- Identified how hyperparameter choices influence the modelâ€™s energy and hidden space geometry.  
- Revealed interpretable patterns in the latent representations using dimensionality reduction and clustering.
